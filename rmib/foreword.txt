Foreword 

Our prosperity as a nation depends upon the personal financial prosperity of each of us as 
individuals. 

This book deals with the personal successes of each of us. Success means accomplishments as the 
result of our own efforts and abilities. Proper preparation is the key to our success. Our acts 
can be no wiser than our thoughts. Our thinking can be no wiser than our understanding. 

This book of cures for lean purses has been termed a guide to financial understanding. That, indeed, is 
its purpose: to offer those who are ambitious for financial success an insight which will aid 
them to acquire money, to keep money and to make their surpluses earn more money. 

In the pages which follow, we are taken back to Babylon, the cradle in which was nurtured the 
basic principles of finance now recognized and used the world over. 

To new readers the author is happy to extend the wish that its pages may contain for them the same 
inspiration for growing bank accounts, greater financial successes and the solution of difficult 
personal financial problems so enthusiastically reported by readers from coast to coast. 

To the business executives who have distributed these tales in such generous quantities to friends, 
relatives, employees and associates, the author takes this opportunity to express his gratitude. No 
endorsement could be higher than that of practical men who appreciate its teachings because they, 
themselves, have worked up to important successes by applying the very principles it advocates. 

Babylon became the wealthiest city of the ancient world because its citizens were the richest 
people of their time. They appreciated the value of money. They practiced sound financial principles 
in acquiring money, keeping money and making their money earn more money. They provided for 
themselves what we all desire . . . incomes for the future.
