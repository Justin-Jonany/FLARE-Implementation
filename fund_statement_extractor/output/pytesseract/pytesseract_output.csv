Trading ETFs

ETFs hold a basket of investments, like mutual funds, but trade on exchanges like stocks. Here are a few things to keep in mind when trading
ETFs:

Pricing
ETFs have two sets of prices: market price and net asset value (NAV).
Market price

+ ETFs are bought and sold on exchanges at the market price. The market price can change throughout the trading day. Factors like supply,
demand, and changes in the value of an ETF’s investments can effect the market price.

+ You can get price quotes any time during the trading day. Quotes have two parts: bid and ask.

+ The bid is the highest price a buyer is willing to pay if you want to sell your ETF units. The ask is the lowest price a seller is willing to accept
if you want to buy ETF units. The difference between the two is called the “bid-ask spread”.

+ Ingeneral, a smaller bid-ask spread means the ETF is more liquid. That means you are more likely to get the price you expect.
Net asset value (NAV)

+ Like mutual funds, ETFs have a NAV. It is calculated after the close of each trading day and reflects the value of an ETF’s investments at
that point in time.

+ NAVis used to calculate financial information for reporting purposes - like the returns shown in this document.
Orders

There are two main options for placing trades: market orders and limit orders. A market order lets you buy or sell units at the current market
price. A limit order lets you set the price at which you are willing to buy or sell units.

Timing
In general, market prices of ETFs can be more volatile around the start and end of the trading day. Consider using a limit order or placing a
trade at another time during the trading day.

The table shows the best and worst returns for units of the ETF in a 3-month period. However, this information is not available because the ETF has

Trading ETFs

 

ETFs hold a basket of investments, like mutual funds, but trade on exchanges like stocks. Here are a few things to keep in mind when trading ETFs:

Pricing
ETFs have two sets of prices: market price and net asset value (NAV).
Market price
* ETFs are bought and sold in exchanges at the market price. The market price can change throughout the trading day. Factors like supply,
demand and changes in the value of an ETF's investments can effect the market price.
* You can get price quotes any time during the trading day. Quotes have two parts: bid and ask.

* The bid is the highest price a buyer is willing to pay if you want to sell your ETF units. The ask is the lowest price a seller is willing to accept if you
want to buy ETF units. The difference between the two is called the ""bid-ask spread"".

* In general, a smaller bid-ask spread means the ETF is more liquid. That means you are more likely to get the price you expect.

Net asset value (NAV)
* Like mutual funds, ETFs have a NAV. It is calculated after the close of each trading day and reflects the value of an ETF's investments at that
point in time.
* NAV is used to calculate financial information for reporting purposes - like the returns shown in this document.

Orders

There are two main options for placing trades: market orders and limit orders. A market order lets you buy or sell units at the current market price. A
limit order lets you set the price at which you are willing to buy or sell units.

Timing

In general, market prices of ETFs can be more volatile around the start and end of the trading day. Consider using a limit order or placing a trade at
another time during the trading day.

H HOW RISKY IS IT?
The value of the Fund can go down as well as up. You could lose money.

One way to gauge risk is to look at how much a fund's returns change over
time. This is called “volatility”.

In general, funds with higher volatility will have returns that change more

over time. They typically have a greater chance of losing money and may

have a greater chance of higher returns.Funds with lower volatility tend to
have returns that change less over time. They typically have lower returns

and may have a lower chance of losing money.

What does the ETF invest in?

The ETF seeks to replicate, to the extent reasonably possible and before fees and expenses, the performance of a Canadian aggregate bond index
that measures the investment return of the Canadian investment grade bond market. Currently, the ETF seeks to track the Morningstar® Canada Core
Bond Index™ (the ""Index""), or any successor thereto. The ETF may invest in and hold the constituent securities of the Index in approximately the
same proportion as the Index or employ a sampling strategy to hold a portfolio of constituent securities and/or other securities selected by the
portfolio manager that closely matches the aggregate investment characteristics of the Index.

Trading ETFs
ETFs hold a basket of investments, like mutual funds, but trade on exchanges like stocks. Here are a few things to keep in mind when trading ETFs:
Pricing
ETFs have two sets of prices: market price and net asset value (NAV).
Market price

+ ETFs are bought and sold on exchanges at the market price. The market price can change throughout the trading day. Factors like supply,
demand, and changes in the value of an ETF’s investments can affect the market price.

+ You can get price quotes any time during the trading day. Quotes have two parts: bid and ask.

* The bid is the highest price a buyer is willing to pay if you want to sell your ETF units. The ask is the lowest price a seller is willing to accept if
you want to buy ETF units. The difference between the two is called the “bid-ask spread”.

* In general, a smaller bid-ask spread means the ETF is more liquid. That means you are more likely to get the price you expect.
Net asset value (NAV)

+ Like mutual funds, ETFs have a NAV. It is calculated after the close of each trading day and reflects the value of an ETF’s investments at that
point in time.

+ NAV is used to calculate financial information for reporting purposes — like the returns shown in this document.
Orders

There are two main options for placing trades: market orders and limit orders. A market order lets you buy or sell units at the current market price. A
limit order lets you set the price at which you are willing to buy or sell units.

Timing
In general, market prices of ETFs can be more volatile around the start and end of the trading day. Consider using a limit order or placing a trade at
another time during the trading day.

HOW RISKY IS IT?

The value of the ETF can go down as well as up. You could lose money.

One way to gauge risk is to look at how much an ETF's returns change over time.

This is called ""volatility"".

In general, ETFs with higher volatility will have returns that change more over
time. They typically have a greater chance of losing money and may have a
greater chance of higher returns. ETFs with lower volatility tend to have returns
that change less over time. They typically have lower returns and may have a
lower chance of losing money.
