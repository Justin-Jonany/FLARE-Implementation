Trading ETFs
ETFs hold a basket of investments, like mutual funds, but trade on exchanges like stocks. Here are a few things to keep in mind when trading ETFs:
Pricing
ETFs have two sets of prices: market price and net asset value (NAV)
Market price
ETFs are bought and sold on exchanges at the market price_
The market price can change throughout the trading day. Factors like supply,
demand, and changes in the value of an ETF's investments can affect the market price_
You can
price quotes any time during the trading day: Quotes have two parts: bid and ask_
The bid is the highest price a buyer is willing to pay if you want to sell your ETF units_
The ask is the lowest
a seller is
willing to accept if
you want to
ETF units_
The difference between the two is called the ""bid-ask spread"" _
In general,
a smaller bid-ask spread means the ETF is more liquid. That means you are more likely to
the price you expect.
Net asset value (NAV)
Like mutual funds, ETFs have a NAV. It is calculated after the close of each trading
and reflects the value of an ETF's investments at that
point in time_
NAV is used to calculate financial information for reporting purposes
like the returns shown in this document.
Orders
There are two main options
placing trades: market orders and limit orders. A market order lets you
or sell units at the current market price: A
limit order lets you set the
at which you are willing to
or sell units
Timing
In general, market prices of ETFs can be more volatile around the start and end of the trading day: Consider using a limit order or placing a trade at
another time during the trading
