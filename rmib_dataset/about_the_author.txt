About the author 

GEORGE SAMUEL CLASON was born in Louisiana, Missouri, on November 7, 1874. He 
attended the University of Nebraska and served in the United States Army during the Spanish- 
American War. Beginning a long career in publishing, he founded the Clason Map Company of Denver, 
Colorado, and published the first road atlas of the United States and Canada. In 1926, he issued the 
first of a famous series of pamphlets on thrift and financial success, using parables set in ancient 
Babylon to make each of his points. These were distributed in large quantities by banks and 
insurance companies and became familiar to millions, the most famous being "The Richest Man 
in Babylon," the parable from which the present volume takes its title. These "Babylonian parables" 
have become a modern inspirational classic.
